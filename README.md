# OBJECTIVE :
The objective of this project is to demonstrate two different approaches to text generation using deep learning. First, it uses a pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a user-provided prompt. GPT-2 is a transformer-based model trained on a large corpus of text, allowing it to generate natural language output without additional training. Second, the project defines a custom LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model using TensorFlow and Keras. This LSTM model is designed for sequence prediction tasks, such as next-word prediction, and can be trained on custom datasets. By combining both models in the same script, this project highlights the power of pre-trained language models like GPT-2 as well as the flexibility of building and training your own RNN-based models like LSTM.
